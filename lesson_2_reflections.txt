What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize your repository a .git directory is started in your file (it 
starts with a "." because it is meant to be hidden from the average user. To see 
it you should use ls -a) 

This directory starts a repository but it does not start tracking your files until 
you commit. It doesn't track them automatically because you may want to add a
custom message to it. Also, you may not want to track all the files in the directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area collects many snapshots before you do a commit. It's more 
granular since you could store more changes than one logical change during a
commit
